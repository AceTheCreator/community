# Season of Docs

Google [Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) gives technical writers an opportunity to work with open source projects.

## 2022 participation

AsyncAPI has been [accepted as a mentoring organization](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/2022/participants) in Season of Docs (GSoD) 2022!

### âŒ› Timeline
The project itself will take approximately 4-6 months to complete, depending on the different levels of knowledge from diverse technical writers (TW) that might get involved. (At AsyncAPI, we want to work with any TW, regardless of their years of experience. We have a passion for mentorship, and we do not wish to have a bar that would prevent any TW from contributing to our OSS Initiative. In fact, we look forward to potentially mentoring TW(s) who are completely new to tech and making them feel welcome!)

For our 2 projects, we would like to request a minimum of 2 TWs, so that we can work on both the CLI/Tools and Generator Docs. 

The timeline would look as following:
- **May:** Orientation on how to contribute to AsyncAPI Inititiave, how Docs issues are organized, detail how we're migrating our CLI and Tools Docs, and assign good `first-time-tickets` to get each new TW contributor started. 
- **June - August:**	Each TW goes through designated issues marked for both first time contributors and work set aside for `GSoD 2022`. Each TW starts creating documentation for their individual issues assigned/selected. 
- **September - October:** We determine if we're going to be able to complete both CLI and Tools Docs plus the Generator Docs, depending on how many TWs are in our group and how much they've been able to complete so far. We re-align priorities as needed and asses what is missing to reach our 2022 IA change goals for AsyncAPI Docs.
- **November:**	Project completion and all contributors receive some swag! 


### ðŸ’¸ Project budget
We have set aside 2 mentors for now, for our 2 projects: improving our IA and re-structuring our Generator Docs. Should we be selected, AsyncAPI would like to request from Google a US $5000 budget for each project. For both projects, the request then totals for a $10,000 budget.  

| **Budget item**                                                                                      | **Total Amount** |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Technical writer updates, reviews, edits, and publishing new documentation for the IA improvements.  | $5000            |
| Technical writer updates, reviews, migration, and publishing improved Generator tool documentation.  | $5000            |
