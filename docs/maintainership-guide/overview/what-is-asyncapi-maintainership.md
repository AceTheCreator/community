The AsyncAPI Maintainership Program (AMP) is the official mentorship initiative piloted by the AsyncAPI community, designed to empower aspiring open source contributors and guide them toward becoming active code triagers and maintainers of AsyncAPI projects. Born out of AsyncAPI’s deep commitment to open source and community growth, this program creates a structured pathway for contributors to gain hands-on experience, mentorship, and long-term engagement within the ecosystem.

The main goal of the maintainership program is to foster knowledge transfer, skills, and experience from existing maintainers to contributors. This not only helps contributors grow into maintainers but also ensures the long-term sustainability and health of the AsyncAPI initiative.

At AsyncAPI, the Maintainership Program serves as a practical framework for teaching, upskilling, and empowering contributors — creating meaningful growth for mentees and lasting impact for mentors.

To ensure a smooth and supportive experience for everyone involved, we prioritize a healthy, human-centered approach to open source. Some of the measures we take to support both contributors and mentors include:

- Minimizing stress and pressure throughout the program
- Encouraging participants to ask for help without hesitation
- Fostering regular and open communication
- Sharing stories, challenges, and personal experiences
- Aligning expectations early on
- Offering flexible timelines and deadlines
- Promoting self-care and mental well-being

Beyond technical skills, the program provides a realistic view into what it means to maintain an open source project, the rewarding moments as well as the tough ones, and equips contributors with tools to navigate both the technical and emotional aspects of open source work.
