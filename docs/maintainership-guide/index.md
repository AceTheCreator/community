## The AsyncAPI Maintainership Organizer Guide

**Welcome to the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program Guide! This is a community-driven resource that captures everything we've learned from organizing, mentoring, collaborating, and building with contributors across the globe all wrapped into one handy playbook for aspiring maintainers.**

Whether you're new to open source or ready to level up your opensource skills, this guide will walk you through the principles, practices, and expectations of being a successful participant under the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program.

> _Note: The Maintainership organizer guide is never finished. It's an ongoing project that we are always trying to update as we and the broader community of program organizers learn and grow together._
