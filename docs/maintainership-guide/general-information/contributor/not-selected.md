We truly appreciate the time, energy, and passion you put into applying for a mentorship role in the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program. While we couldn’t accommodate every applicant at any cohort of the program, **not being selected is not a reflection of your skills or potential**, our decision was shaped by project needs, availability, and alignment with specific contributor experiences.

That said, **your journey with AsyncAPI doesn’t have to end here**:

- **Stay Involved:** Join discussions, create issues, submit PRs, or participate in community calls. The more visible and active you are in the community, the more likely you are to be selected in future cohorts.

- **Contribute to Other Areas:** We’re always looking for community champions across documentation, tooling, advocacy, and more. Just raise your hand!

- **Try Again:** Many of our contributors today weren’t selected on their first try. Your continued interest and consistency speak volumes.

If you'd like feedback on your application or want to understand how to better align for the future, feel free to reach out to program organizers. We're here to help you grow, whether you're mentoring or contributing.
