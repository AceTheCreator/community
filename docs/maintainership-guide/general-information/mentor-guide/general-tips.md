Being a mentor is incredibly rewarding, but it also comes with its own set of challenges. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your mentorship experience while maintaining balance and boundaries:

## Take a break when needed

- It's perfectly okay to take a break when life gets hectic
- Communicate with fellow mentors or org admins if you're feeling overwhelmed, we're here to support each other.
- Remember: burnout helps no one,  not you, not the contributor, and not the project.

## it’s Okay to Fail a Contributor

Sometimes, despite best efforts, a mentorship pairing may not work out. It’s acceptable to mark a contributor as “failed” if:

- They disappear or stop communicating
- They oversold their skills and can’t meet the minimum expectations.
- There are persistent personality issues, such as ignoring feedback, being uncooperative, or refusing to follow community standards.

## Set Healthy Boundaries

You are not expected to be available 24/7. Setting clear boundaries helps both you and your mentee thrive. Consider:

- Scheduling weekly or bi-weekly check-ins to track progress and offer guidance.
- Setting up a routine work review to evaluate deliverables.

Defining your working and non-working hours, so expectations are clear from the start.
