The project idea you mentor is the backbone of your AMP experience. A well-scoped, impactful idea not only attracts the right contributor but also ensures a smoother, more rewarding mentorship journey. Here’s what mentors should know and follow when proposing and managing project ideas:

## One Idea, One Contributor

Every AMP project idea is intended for **one dedicated contributor**, with the **exception of documentation-related** projects, which may allow for more than one collaborative effort if clearly scoped. While several applicants may express interest in the same project, **only one proposal will be accepted per idea**. Team-based submissions are not allowed for technical projects; each contributor is solely responsible for their project's execution and success.

## Prioritize Interest & Alignment

Some contributors may flock to a popular idea, while others apply without genuine interest or understanding. As a mentor, it’s important to identify applicants who truly resonate with the project. Look for passion, curiosity, and alignment with the project’s purpose.

## Talk Before You Accept

**Never accept a contributor you haven’t spoken to.** A short chat via Slack or a scheduled call can reveal a lot about a candidate’s motivations, communication style, and fit for the project. This early connection also sets the tone for collaboration during the program.

## Request a Contribution

If you find a candidate worthy of acceptance, ask contributors to submit a small, relevant contribution to your project. This serves as a practical skill check and helps you assess their familiarity with the stack, tooling, and codebase not just what they say in their application.

## Stick to the Plan

Once a project idea is accepted into the program, it **cannot be changed.** Ensure your project scope is clear, realistic, and well-defined from the start. Contributors should tailor their proposals accordingly, and no major pivots are allowed once the program begins.
