## Donating Your Project

Donating your open-source project to an open-source initiative involves transferring ownership or stewardship to an organization that supports and promotes open-source software. This can help ensure the project's sustainability, attract more contributors, and align it with broader community goals.

Here at the AsyncAPI initiative, we are open to receiving project donations that align with our goals and values. Before considering donating your project to the initiative, kindly visit our [Roadmap](https://www.asyncapi.com/roadmap) to learn more about what we are looking at as a community in the nearest future. 

### Project Licensing

Donating your project to an open-source organization like AsyncAPI can be exciting, hence why we need to ensure one of the most important parts of open-source projects, which is licensing. 

The AsyncAPI Initiative uses the [Apache-2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), which ensures our projects are open-source and community-driven, so before considering putting your project up for donation, you need to ensure your project uses a compatible open-source license. 

### Legal Consideration

All the projects under the AsyncAPI initiative are strictly community-driven, so to avoid any problems, we put legal consideration into donating projects to the initiative. 

- **Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)**: This agreement ensures that the project's maintainers have the legal right to distribute and modify the code contributed by various individuals. This helps us protect both our maintainers and contributors. 
- **Intellectual Property (IP) Review**: sometimes, project donation doesn't come from individual contributors, sometimes, it comes from organizations, and we need to verify the ownership and the chain of title to ensure no proprietary code or third-party IP is included.

### Community Engagement

When donating your project to a community-driven initiative like AsyncAPI, you should understand that communication is an integral part of the initiative. So, before donating your project, communication with the community has to be established. 

Follow the instructions below to establish and involve the community in your project donation:

1. Visit [AsyncAPI Initiative Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions).
2. Create a new discussion by clicking on `New discussion` and select the `Idea` category. Specify in the _title_ that you want to donate to an existing project. In the _description_, state the purpose of the new repository and why it should be part of the AsyncAPI organization. Here's a  [sample discussion about donating existing project](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/643)
3. Start a discussion with community members to discuss the project idea, and specify if you want to use AsyncAPI CI/CD workflows, and volunteer to become a maintainer for that project, and for better visibility, share the discussion in the #general channel on our Slack. 
4. Answer questions from contributors and maintainers about your project and also ask relevant questions about your project donation

### Project Migration

After a successful community engagement, we can now move on to the final phase, which is the project migration. In other to establish a successful project migration here are the step to follow:

1. Visit the [AsyncAPI Community Repo](https://github.com/asyncapi/community) and open a [new issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=enhancement.yml&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+%3Cdescription%3E) 
2. Write in details about your project and include a summary of the community discussion about your project
3. Tag the `@asyncapi/tsc_members` at the end of the proposal description, asking for a vote on migrating your project to the organization. This notifies all TSC members to vote on the proposed project because the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) must approve the project donation. 
4. If the TSC approves the new repository, then either `@derberg` or `@fmvilas` will take over the project migration to the AsyncAPI organization. 
5. Next, CI pipelines will be configured to match the initiative's standards and they'll run AsyncAPI CI/CD workflows to push basic GitHub Actions workflows to the newly donated project. 
6. Finally, new maintainers will be invited as repo admins.

### Post Donation Maintenance

Successfully donating a project doesn't mean the end of your journey with it. On the contrary, the post-donation phase is crucial for the sustained health and growth of the project. To ensure that your project continues to thrive and benefit its users long after the donation, here are several key practices to implement:

- **Ongoing Contributions**: your involvement shouldn't stop with the donation. Continue actively contributing to the project by adding new features, refining existing functionalities, and fixing bugs. This demonstrates ongoing commitment and encourages others to contribute as well.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep the project's documentation up-to-date. This includes guides for installation, configuration, and usage, as well as API reference materials. As the project evolves, it's essential that the documentation reflects these changes accurately to assist both new and existing users.
- **Community Support**: Engage with the community by offering support, answering questions, providing feedback on user suggestions, and addressing any concerns. A vibrant, supportive community is key to a project's sustainability.
