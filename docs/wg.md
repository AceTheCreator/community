AsyncAPI has taken a significant leap forward in our journey towards fostering a vibrant and inclusive community by establishing the "Maintainers Growth Working Group." This initiative marks a pivotal moment in our collective effort to expand our horizons and deepen our impact within the AsyncAPI organization. 

The "Maintainers Growth Working Group" exemplifies our steadfast commitment to nurturing an inclusive and dynamic community.

## Maintainers Growth Objectives

The "Maintainers Growth Working Group" is committed to multifaceted objectives, striving for ambitious, attainable goals. Our focus areas include:
1. **Expand Horizons**: Significantly increase the number of maintainers across the AsyncAPI organization. This expansion will bring diverse perspectives and skill sets, enriching our community and projects.
2. **Optimize Onboarding Experience**: Acknowledging the importance of a smooth onboarding experience for new maintainers, we endeavor to refine and optimize this process. Our aim is to make it intuitive, informative, and supportive, ensuring that newcomers feel valued and empowered from the outset.
3. **Embrace Diversity**: We are steadfast in our commitment to increasing the representation of non-Postman maintainers. Diversity is not merely a buzzword but a motivation for innovation and resilience within our community. We eagerly embrace maintainers from varied backgrounds and experiences.
4. **Build a Support System**: Recognizing the challenges and responsibilities inherent in the role of a maintainer, we are dedicated to establishing a comprehensive support system. We aim to offer guidance, resources, and assistance whenever needed, fostering a sense of support and empowerment among maintainers.
5. **Nurture Talent**: We are passionate about identifying and nurturing potential maintainers among our regular contributors. We recognize the value of nurturing talents within our community and providing avenues for growth and leadership.

## Invitation to Collaborate
We are pleased to invite prospective maintainers to join our ranks. If your project stands to benefit from our support, we encourage you to reach out. Our community is currently modest, so we operate on a first-come, first-served basis. With one project already in the pipeline, prompt action is advisable. Whether you are a longstanding member of our community or contemplating joining us, we eagerly anticipate the opportunity to connect.
